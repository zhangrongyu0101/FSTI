            Large Language Models (LLMs) like the GPT and LLaMA series have
            revolutionized natural language processing, excelling as
            generalpurpose AI assistants. However, their dominant interaction
            paradigm is passive and reactive; they faithfully execute user
            commands, but the user always leads the conversation. This passivity
            fundamentally limits their application in scenarios requiring
            proactive guidance toward complex goals.

          </h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-left text-current dark:text-white">
            Proactive conversational agents, which aim to guide conversations to
            achieve complex objectives, are a key frontier of autonomous agent
            research. However, although existing large language models are
            efficient passive responders, they have a fundamental capability
            deficiency in autonomously planning and executing longhorizon,
            goal-oriented conversational strategies. The severe scarcity of
            high-quality real-world training data further exacerbates this
            limitation.To address this challenge, we propose FSTI (From
            Simulation to Interaction), a brand-new paradigm for building
            proactive conversational agents. This framework first utilizes a
            four-agent simulation architecture that decouples role-playing,
            process advancement, and quality assessment, to synthesize
            large-scale, highfidelity data for complex financial mediation
            proactive dialogues in realistic adversarial scenarios.
            Subsequently, FSTI adopts a threestage progressive training scheme
            to efficiently distill the emergent procedural knowledge and
            strategic behaviors from the simulation data into a compact final
            model.Experimental results show that the 8B-parameter model trained
            via FSTI exhibits deep internalization of the complex mediation
            process. On the highly challenging proactive financial mediation
            dialogue task, its performance not only significantly surpasses
            top-tier closed-source models such as GPT-4o, but it is also fully
            suitable for real-world deployment with strict requirements for
            latency. FSTI provides a path that is both effective and scalable
            for building truly autonomous and efficient conversational agents.
